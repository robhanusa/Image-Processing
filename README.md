# Image-Processing
Uses deep learning to process images.

## Tumor Recognition
[Tumor_recognition.ipynp](https://github.com/robhanusa/Image-Processing/blob/main/Tumor_recognition.ipynb) uses a set of 253 brain MRI images from https://www.kaggle.com/navoneel/brain-mri-images-for-brain-tumor-detection, each of which either contains a brain tumor or is tumor-free. A deep learning algorithm is trained to predict the presence of a tumor in the images.

## MNIST Dataset
[Digit_recognition.ipynb](https://github.com/robhanusa/Image-Processing/blob/main/Digit_recognition.ipynb) is a simple deep learning example using a the MNIST dataset of digits in the tensorflow library. All images are 28x28 greyscale images of digits 0-9. This shows the basic structure of using tensorflow to categorize images.
